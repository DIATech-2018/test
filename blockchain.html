		<p class="bigLeftText" style="font-size: 20px;">A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. In other words, the blockchain is like a database hosted all around the world by many bitcoin hosts/servers (generally mining computers that are processing transactions, also known as ‘nodes’ on the network) that stores vital information about the cryptocurrency and all recent transactions in chronological order. This network is then encrypted using modern encryption methods. A block is a current record of some of the transactions. After a set amount of time, this ‘block’ is then saved permanently on the network and a new block is generated for new transactions to be recorded on. The blockchain isn’t just used for powering cryptocurrency networks, and can be found powering smart contracts (currently in use by Ethereum), financial and medical records (currently in use by Du for clinics and hospitals in the UAE).</p>
