		<p class="bigLeftText" style="font-size: 20px;">Today cryptocurrencies have become a global phenomenon known to most people; while still somehow geeky and not understood by most people, banks, governments and many companies are aware of its importance. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled. Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown inventor of Bitcoin, the first and still most important cryptocurrency, never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said he developed “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.“ His goal was to invent something many people failed to create before digital cash- However this idea turned into something significantly bigger- possibly the future of today’s monetary system.</p>
