	<h1 class="bigLeftTitle">What is CryptoCurrency?</h1>
	<h3 class="bigLeftSubtitle">How Does it Work? Where did they come from?</h3>
	<img class="bigLeftIMG" src="Images/landing-background.jpg">
	<p class="bigLeftText">Today cryptocurrencies have become a global phenomenon known to most people; while still somehow geeky and not understood by most people, banks, governments and many companies are aware of its importance. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled. Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown inventor of Bitcoin, the first and still most important cryptocurrency, never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said he developed “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.“ His goal was to invent something many people failed to create before digital cash- However this idea turned into something significantly bigger- possibly the future of today’s monetary system.</p>

	<img class="miniIMG" src="Images/landing-background.jpg">
	<p class="miniText">Many people believe that cryptocurrencies are the hottest investment opportunity currently available. Indeed, there are many stories of people becoming millionaires through their Bitcoin investments. However, it is worth noting that cryptocurrencies are high-risk investments. Their market value fluctuates like no other asset’s. If you decide to invest in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is obviously still the dominant one. Regardless, in 2017 its share in the crypto-market has quite dramatically fallen from 90 to just 40 percent.</p>

	<img class="miniIMG" src="Images/landing-background.jpg">
	<p class="miniText">A blockchain is a digitised, decentralised, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. In other words, the blockchain is like a database hosted all around the world by many bitcoin hosts/servers (generally mining computers that are processing transactions, also known as ‘nodes’ on the network) that stores vital information about the cryptocurrency and all recent transactions in chronological order. The Blockchain is generally titled as the "backbone" of cryptocurrencies - without which the whole system would be flawed!</p>

	<h4 class="miniSubtitle">Learn More About Mining CryptoCurrencies!</h4>
	<img class="miniIMG" src="Images/landing-background.jpg">
	<p class="miniText">Miners are the single most important part of any cryptocurrency network, and much like trading, mining is an investment. Essentially, miners are providing a bookkeeping service for their respective communities. They contribute their computing power to solving complicated cryptographic puzzles, which is necessary to confirm and record the transaction in a distributed public ledger. One of the interesting things about mining is that the difficulty of the puzzles is constantly increasing, correlating with number of people solving it.</p>

	<p class="miniText">In order to complete a more practical and engaging approach to understanding the importance and functionality of cryptocurrencies for those who are not as advanced in terms of prior knowledge on the topic, we have decided to create a virtual reality-based game which emulates the basic functions of how cryptocurrencies work in real life. The game design shows the mining aspect of cryptocurrencies, which works through different graphics cards on the computer's hardware.</p>
