	<h1 class="bigLeftTitle">What is CryptoCurrency?</h1>
	<h3 class="bigLeftSubtitle">How Does it Work? Where did they come from?</h3>
	<img class="bigLeftIMG" src="Images/landing-background.jpg">
	<p class="bigLeftText">Today cryptocurrencies have become a global phenomenon known to most people; while still somehow geeky and not understood by most people, banks, governments and many companies are aware of its importance. A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptography to secure and verify transactions as well as to control the creation of new units of a particular cryptocurrency. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled. Satoshi Nakamoto, the unknown inventor of Bitcoin, the first and still most important cryptocurrency, never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said he developed “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.“ His goal was to invent something many people failed to create before digital cash- However this idea turned into something significantly bigger- possibly the future of today’s monetary system.</p>

	<p class="miniText">A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. In other words, the blockchain is like a database hosted all around the world by many bitcoin hosts/servers (generally mining computers that are processing transactions, also known as ‘nodes’ on the network) that stores vital information about the cryptocurrency and all recent transactions in chronological order. This network is then encrypted using modern encryption methods. A block is a current record of some of the transactions. After a set amount of time, this ‘block’ is then saved permanently on the network and a new block is generated for new transactions to be recorded on. The blockchain isn’t just used for powering cryptocurrency networks, and can be found powering smart contracts (currently in use by Ethereum), financial and medical records (currently in use by Du for clinics and hospitals in the UAE).</p>
